Some products might consist of multiple Android devices connected together, where not all of the devices have direct internet access - this presents a challenge uploading diagnostics (and downloading settings) from the un-connected *companion* devices.

The Bort SDK (since version 4.0) supports offloading data the *companion* devices, if there is a socket connection available to communicate between them. This is **client-server mode**.

## Client-Server mode

Disabled by default, Bort's client-server mode allows designating a network-connected Android device running the Bort SDK as *server*. One or more connected devices without direct network access can be designated *client*.

Bort running on the *client* device will collect and forward diagnostic data to Bort running on the *server* device via a socket connection, so that the data can be forwarded to Memfault's web services.

Data is bundled together in a MAR archive. This zipped file format collects several types of data (e.g. logs, metrics, bug reports) together, so that they can be uploaded in one file - resulting in fewer http requests.

## Supported features

All data collected by Bort (bugreports, logs, metrics, crashes/WTFs/ANRs/etc) is forwarded from *client* devices to Memfault's web services when using **client-server** mode.

Bort running on the *server* device will forward SDK settings to the *client* device - this ensures that Bort on both devices is always fully remotely configurable.

## Enabling Client-Server connectivity

This mode is disabled by default. To enable, there are two configuration steps:

### Configure Client-Server system property on each device

Set a system property (`vendor.memfault.bort.client.server.mode`) on each of the devices, describing its role. This might be set in a `product.mk` file specific to each device e.g.:

```
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES += vendor.memfault.bort.client.server.mode=server
```

or

```
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES += vendor.memfault.bort.client.server.mode=client
```

If this property is absent, or not set to either `server` or `client` then the client-server feature is disabled.

This property is configured individually per device. A system property is used for this reason (so that the Bort SDK does not have to be configured/compiled separately for each device).

### Configure socket communication parameters

Set the `CLIENT_SERVER_PORT` and `CLIENT_SERVER_HOST` parameters in `bort.properties`. The *server* device must be able to listen for connections on this port, and the *client* devices must be able to communicate with the *server* using this hostname and port.

The Bort `UsageReporter` persistent service on the *server* device will listen for connections on this host/port, and on *client* devices will attempt to establish a connection with the *server* device.

:::info

This property is configured as part of the Bort build - this enables the use of the same Bort/UsageReporter apks on each of the devices (i.e. it is *not* required to maintain/build separately configured versions of the Bort SDK for each of the connected Android devices).

:::

### Configure network interfaces

Ensure that device network/firewall configuration is set up so that the client/server devices can communicate using the hostname/port specified in your `bort.properties` file.

For security reasons, the network interface that the *server* device is listening on should not be publicly accessible - it is expected to be an interface which can only communicate with the *client* device.
